## ðŸš€ Key React Features

This project utilizes essential React concepts to deliver optimal performance, maintainability, and a smooth user experience:

- **Component Structure**: Modular components like `Navbar`, `Footer`, `ProductCard`, and `Modal` ensure consistency and reusability.
- **React Router**: Handles navigation between pages, including a custom 404 page for unmatched routes.
- **Hooks**: Uses `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useNavigate`, and `useLocation` to manage state and enable navigation.
- **Context API**: Provides global state management for the cart and wishlist, ensuring efficient data sharing across components.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Displays components based on user actions, such as showing toast notifications when items are added to the cart or wishlist.

## ðŸ›  Data Management and Persistence

Using the **Context API** for global state management, Blu Gadgets manages the flow of data for the cart and wishlist. For data persistence, **LocalStorage** retains cart and wishlist items across sessions, allowing users to return and continue shopping seamlessly.
